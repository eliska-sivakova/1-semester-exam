    <p class="text">This project was my first touch with animation. Week assignment has created a character with 10 buttons. When the user clicks a button, the character starts a specific animation.
    <br><br>
    As my character, I choose Santa Claus because I really love Christmas and Christmas mood. Also, I decided to choose background thematically. Winter town graphic with snowman perfect match my character. As my buttons, I choose an animation for a move, move to 30%, move from 30%, jump, one jump, glow, fade. fall down, mirror and shake.
    <br><br>
    In this assignment, I used CSS animation and also I have learned the basics of JavaScript.

    <p class="text">In this project, I had to create a story with 3 characters and defined message of my story. Used CCS animation on my main character and created dramaturgic curve.
    <br><br>
    My main characters are young jellyfish Loffy and her mom Marry. They are on their way to a neighborly cliff. Big undersea world is waking up slowly. They are meeting old friend shark Steeve and enjoying the beauty of the clean ocean on their way. Suddenly, just above their heads, a big boat is brought by waves of the ocean. Sailors from the boat are throwing a big sack of trash to the water. Rubbish is slowly falling to the bottom. The jellyfishes
    are dumbfounded. Marry is covering Loffy´s eyes so she doesn´t have to look at this scenery how their beautiful home is becoming a junkyard.
    <br><br>
    In this assignment, I have learned sketch and draw graphics in Illustrator. Drawing graphics with a consistent visual expression in a specific style.

    We used the interactive element as a play button or clickable bag full of trash.
    <br><br>
    During this week I used my creative thinking and coding skills within a group.

    We choose the fly with annoying audio, you have to catch the fly to stop it. And second simply calculator for add two numbers.

<div class="content">
    <p class="text">This project was group work. I was in Group 7 with Klajdi Ajdini, Konstantinos Anagnostou, Maryam Dadkhah, Neringa Ivanov, Dasa Jarinova and Michaela Semanova. We had to create interactive production some scene from, movie or fairytale in our given style.
    <br><br>
    Our given style was surrealism so that’s why we were trying to find a story/fairytale which would match this theme. We decided to choose the story about Pinocchio, who is an unrealistic character made from wood, so we thought it will match well with our theme. The scene from Pinocchio which we choose was the smoking scene. We also change something and add some surrealistic elements like clouds with eyes or deformed clock.
    <br><br>
    My role was a graphic designer. I drew Storyboard, created a logo for our story and drew all the backgrounds. I also created Personas collage and Screencast (video documentation).
