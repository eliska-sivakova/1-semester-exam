    <p class="text">In this video project, we were supposed to express story without using any words or recorded voice.
    <br><br>
    This assignment was for people of 3. I created a group with Michaela Semanova and Dasa Jarinova. The story is about the adult girl who is studying at KEA. At the beginning of the story, she just wakes up. His boyfriend prepares breakfast for her and she looks so nice in the morning without make-up or styling. After that, she is on way to school. She bikes to school every day but today is especially nice weather outside. When she comes to school she finds that there are no lectures today. Everything is almost perfect. But then…
    <br><br>
    In this project, I have learned the basics of video making, recording, and editing. My role was editing and recording video, I used for it  Adobe Premiere CC.

    <p class="text">On this project, I worked with Fernando Ceres Montesinos, Natasha Lefort, Angel Ezra Meyer, and Liliya Popova. Our assignment was created website and video for Copenhagen Municipality “We Bike”.
    <br><br>
    On the website you can find 3 pages. Homepage, a page about transport + our video and page about Harbour circle. We used a simple design, the logo of Copenhagen Municipality, font family Roboto and black, red and white color scheme.
    <br><br>
    The main idea of our video is that taking the bike in CPH is more convenient.
    It the video are two students. Student A and student B. Student A is trying to take the bus to get to school in time and student B is taking the bike.
    Student A waiting, waiting and waiting for the bus, and comes to school late. Student B, makes it in time!
    <br><br>
    My main role in this group was UI designer and video director.
